## Installing
Using AppsCode apis is easy. First, use `go get` to install the latest version of the library.

    > go get -v github.com/appscode/api

Next, include AppsCode apis in your application:

```go
import "github.com/appcode/api"
```

## Stability
Please note that AppsCode apis are pre-1.0. The implementation is stable but the api signatures might change 
before they hit version 1.0. If you are interested in building on top of AppsCode api, please drop us a line at 
support AT appscode.com with a summary. We are happy to help you with the integration process.
