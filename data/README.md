Searchlight by AppsCode is a Kubernetes operator for [Icinga](https://www.icinga.com/). If you are running production workloads in Kubernetes, you probably want to be alerted when things go wrong. Icinga periodically runs various checks on a Kubernetes cluster and sends notifications if detects an issue. It also nicely supplements whitebox monitoring tools like, [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) with blackbox monitoring can catch problems that are otherwise invisible, and also serves as a fallback in case internal systems completely fail. Searchlight is a CRD controller for Kubernetes built around Icinga to address these issues. This package contains static data files used by Searchlight.
